The most basic concept in ParlAI is an Agent, Agents can be humans, a simple bot which repeats back anything that it hears, your perfectly-tuned neural network, a dataset being read out, or anything else that might send messages or interact with its environment.
Agent must define:

def observe(self, observation) : notifies the agent of an action taken by another agent.
def act(self) : produces an action from the agent.

======================================
Try to run local human with some task

python examples/eval_model.py -m local_human -t babi:Task1k:1 -dt valid
========DONE! ========================

======================================
Write my own agent
1. create_agent should be able to load my agent module using import_module
	Python Module Naming convention. For now, copy the way other agents have been built
2. However, once the agent is created, how does it integrate with the world
	World object takes in the type of task(s) and type of agent(s).
	For single task, DialoguePartnerWorld is created.


What constitutes an environment/world?
	World and Task Object. 
	World is created by create_world of different types
	Task by create_task_agent. Specifically it calls the create_agent function of the corresponding task's agent.py file.
	However, if it doesn't exist then create_task_agent_from_taskname of core\agents.py is called which implements a teacher object, by default a DefaultTeacher object is created.
	World object will implement it's parley method that dictates how the agents are supposed to interact
	The script you write will execute world.parley()

For Dialogue_QE:
	DefaultTeacher is DialogueTeacher. It utilizes a class called DialogueData which provides a data structure for accessing textual dialog data.
		This can be used whenever the dialog data is a fixed log of chats
		(i.e not a simulator setting). The logs can include dialog text and possibly
		supervised labels, candidate labels and rewards.
	It is here in DialogueData load where Dialogue_QE's setup_data is getting called and we are screwed
	
	World is DialoguePartnerWorld

======================================
How are you training the dialog agent model? How does it output depending on some input you provide.
